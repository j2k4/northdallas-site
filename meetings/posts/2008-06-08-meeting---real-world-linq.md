You’ve seen Linq demos. Now it’s time to see Linq in action. The real world is sometimes a very ugly place. Come join the discussion around how Linq is being used to solve real world problems, today. No need to understand all the ins and outs of Linq to write code that will be potentially less prone to errors while definitely being easier to grok; especially when you return to the code six months later.

Woot.com is an online store and community that focuses on selling cool stuff cheap. It started as an employee-store slash market-testing type of place for an electronics distributor, but it's taken on a life of its own. We are experiencing tremendous and exciting growth. Woot Inc. took the top spot in the fourth annual Comerica Bank Collin 60, an awards program aimed at highlighting some of the county's fastest-growing small companies. The Web retailer also came in first in the annual rankings released last November by Southern Methodist University, which listed the 100 fastest-growing private firms in North Texas.

What is Woot? Look at wikipedia. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woot.com](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woot.com)
