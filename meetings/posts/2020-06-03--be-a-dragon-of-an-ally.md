<p style="color:red;font-weight:bold;padding-bottom:15px">NOTE: This talk references current relevant social issues we can face in our daily lives in Technology roles.</p>

We were all horrified when George Floyd was murdered, when Ahmaud Arbery was lynched, when women first reported their #MeToo moments, and at so many other injustices. How do we take that shock and horror and translate it to daily changes in our own lives? How do we become the type of allies who turn the tide and make a difference? There are so many things we can do in our own lives, our own communities, and our own work. We’ll talk about how to do our own internal work first, use our privileges to help others, and influence the systems that shape our lives. If you went for a run or changed your profile picture in support of justice but don’t know what to do next, this is the talk for you.
