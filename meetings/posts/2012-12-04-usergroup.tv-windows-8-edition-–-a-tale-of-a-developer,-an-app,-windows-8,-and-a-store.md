In this talk Shawn will share how he built the UserGroup.tv app for the Windows Store. He will walk through the basics of putting this type of an application together with C# and XAML. Discuss some of the principals around Windows 8 development, and wrap up with some of the lessons learned from going through the submission process. If you are thinking about building an app for Windows 8 or are just curious what all the buzz is about, come get the unfiltered opinions of someone that has been there, done that.
