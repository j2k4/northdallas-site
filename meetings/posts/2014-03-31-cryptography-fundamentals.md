Our toolsets provide us with plenty of support for encrypting, decrypting, and digitally signing messages. It's amazing how much cryptographic technology is baked right in to the Java and .NET frameworks. Yet, if we don't understand how that technology works, we are in real danger of misusing it. And as we've seen with the Target, Snapchat, and NSA security breaches, such mistakes can be extremely costly. It doesn't have to be difficult. The mathematics behind modern cryptography is surprisingly simple. It isn't the complexity of the math that makes digital cryptography effective. On the contrary, the simplicity of the math gives us confidence that we've learned enough about the space to trust the results. I'll show you the formulas, and demonstrate exactly why -- and how far -- you can trust them.

## Speaker Bio

Software is math. Michael L Perry has built upon the works of mathematicians like Bertrand Meyer, James Rumbaugh, and Donald Knuth to develop a mathematical system for software development. He has captured this system in a set of open source projects, Update Controls and Correspondence. As a Principal Consultant at Improving Enterprises, he applies mathematical concepts to building scalable and robust enterprise systems. You can find out more at [qedcode.com](http://qedcode.com).
