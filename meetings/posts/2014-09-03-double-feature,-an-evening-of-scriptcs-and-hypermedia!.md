In the first part of the evening we'll explore scriptcs ([https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs)) a new lightweight approach for developing with C#. Scriptcs offers a scripting model for C# that feels very much like experience of developing node, PHP and Ruby apps. You can develop outside Visual Studio in a text editor like Sublime Text, or even use the built in REPL to interactively execute C# code. Scriptcs ties in tightly with NuGet allowing you to leverage the universe of packages. It is fully cross-platform supporting development on Windows, Mac and Linux! As a bonus, you can even host it within your own standard .NET apps to allow them to be extended with script! Best of all it's completely open source!

Next we'll move into the realm of building RESTful APIs that are hypermedia driven. Hypermedia is an approach to building APIs that decouples clients from the server and makes clients more reactive. By creating this decoupling, we allow the server and client to independently evolve, reducing the chances for the server to break the client. Hypermedia also paves the way for different versions of clients to run side by side accessing the same API. Beyond that hypermedia opens the door for rich business workflows. In this talk we'll discuss hypermedia and then see how to build a hypermedia system using ASP.NET Web API. We'll base this on the approach used in our recent book: [http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026617.do](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026617.do)
