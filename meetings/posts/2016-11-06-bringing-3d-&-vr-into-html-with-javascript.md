Update: [Here is a link to Ron's presentation](https://rondagdag.github.io/aframe-presentation-kit/#/).

A-Frame is a web framework from Mozilla that makes VR ridiculously easy. A-Frame brings 3D and VR to HTML and JavaScript, allowing us to use the languages, APIs, and tools we all know and love as web developers and designers. With Leap Motion technology available for browsers, I will demonstrate how you can use Virtual Reality and integrate in your robotic projects using all web technologies. A-frame can be easily integrated with any of your ASP.NET, NodeJS projects.

Bring your laptops.
