Helping people learn is fun for us and useful for them. It's also a very effective way to advance your career. Many higher-level development leadership roles expect you to be able to help other developers improve. You can mentor in several ways (e.g. one-on-one mentoring, giving a lecture at an internal company meeting/meetup, et al.) and each require different techniques to be effective.

In this partially hands-on session, I am going to share what I've learned about creating hands-on/interactive labs from teaching at a coding bootcamp, and from running these types of sessions in the workplace and here at this user group. We'll discuss things like how hands-on-labs differ from more monologue style talks, what types of content make sense in these talks and what doesn't, ideas on making sure the content is appropriate, pacing, planning, creating supporting material, how to do multi-session talks, how working with kids is different than adults, et al.

Eric is Director of Software Development for Muv, officer of this Users Group, and former coding instructor. He is the author of a mostly out-of-date book, Mobile ASP.NET MVC 5. When not coding, he likes to read, study history, Bible, and dead languages, think a lot about teaching, and play Minecraft with the kids.
