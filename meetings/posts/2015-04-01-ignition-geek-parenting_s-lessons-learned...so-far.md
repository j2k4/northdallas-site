“A 12yo presenting App Dev at TED? An 11yo presenting Spark to a tech conference? That’s crazy; my kids just want to play games!”

Do you remember what sparked your interest in technology? Everyone has a different story of how that spark ignited into a fire to #LearnAllTheThings.

In this talk, Cori Drew will share the experiences that–as a geek and a parent–left her surprised and enlightened, and will cover tactical ideas of how to ignite that fire in your own kids. Share in the retrospective that led her daughter from a video-gaming 7yo to an 11yo speaker, and walk away with concepts of how to carry our passion for programming to our youth.
