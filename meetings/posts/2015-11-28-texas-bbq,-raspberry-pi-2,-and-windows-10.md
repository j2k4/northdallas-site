Windows 10 Core supports development of apps, using XAML and C#, on the Raspberry Pi 2. In this session we will walk through everything necessary to build a BBQ temperature monitor using Windows 10 and a Raspberry Pi 2. This talk will be focused on writing the code for the application, but a step by step set of instructions will be shared for wiring up the hardware as well. You'll leave with a knowledge of how to work with GPIO devices, and some great pointers on BBQ from the Captain of the Improving Enterprises BBQ Team.

(Safety Note: There will not be any fire during the talk, I will be using a water kettle to reproduce the "heat source" in question)
