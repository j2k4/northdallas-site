Interviews can be stressful but practice helps. This month we are gathering together to help each other out by giving mock interviews. Well, _mostly_ mock interviews as there will be people interviewing that are looking for people to hire. If you are a developer who has experience interviewing other developers and would like to help, please email the officers at [officers@northdallas.net](mailto:officers@northdallas.net). If you would like to be interviewed (no pressure!), RSVP below! Be sure to bring several copies of your resume.

Our current list of interviews (more to come) are as follows!
