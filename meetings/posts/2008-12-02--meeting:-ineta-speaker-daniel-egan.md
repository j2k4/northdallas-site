**Daniel N. Egan – Developer Evangelist - Microsoft**  
Former President INETA – North America  
Former Microsoft Regional Director  
Microsoft MVP ASP/ASP.Net , MCSD, MCT

Before joining Microsoft, I held a variety of positions in the information technology and engineering fields. At Odyssey Consulting Group I served as Chief Architect and CEO. I was fortunate enough to be a Microsoft Regional Director, Microsoft MVP - ASP/ASP.Net , Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT) and an MCSD as well as a .Net Insider for the Southern California Region. I have always been active in the developer community and was the Co-Founder of the SoCalDotNet Developers Group. I had the unique opportunity to serve as President of [INETA](http://www.ineta.org/default.aspx), the international .Net association and enjoyed my time there immensely.

When not working on technical stuff, you can find me shooting away with my Cannon trying to get that “perfect” shot, or teaching a .NET Certification course at California State University Fullerton.
