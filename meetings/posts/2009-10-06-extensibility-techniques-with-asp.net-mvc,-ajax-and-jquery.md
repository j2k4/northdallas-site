# {{ title }}

As you build applications with a framework, you often find yourself running into the same problems. Fortunately, the ASP.NET MVC framework is very extensible. We will discuss some common web development problems and how we can understand and extend the framework to solve our development hurdles.

If you are not familiar with ASP.NET MVC, it might be helpful to learn the basics. Spending some time on [http://www.howmvcworks.net](http://www.howmvcworks.net), [http://www.asp.net/mvc/learn/](http://www.asp.net/mvc/learn/) and [http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/asp-net-mvc-in-action-screencast/](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/asp-net-mvc-in-action-screencast/) would be worth your while.
