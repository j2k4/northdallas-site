<p>In this session I will walk you through setting up a basic CI/CD release flow to Azure for an ASP.NET Core MVC site using Azure DevOps. Consider this a 101-level introduction to Azure DevOps, so this is for those who have little to no experience with the tool.</p>

<h2>Speaker Bio</h2>
<p>Eric is a Principal Consultant for <a href="https://improving.com/">Improving</a>, officer of this Users Group, former coding instructor, and soon-to-be coding instructor once again. He is the author of a mostly out-of-date book, Mobile ASP.NET MVC 5. When not coding, he likes to read, study history, Bible, and dead languages, think a lot about teaching, and play Minecraft with the kids.
