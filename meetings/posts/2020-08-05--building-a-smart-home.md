Blake will discuss his experiences building and maintaining a smart home. Starting from nothing to having a fully automated house can be overwhelming. We’ll cover many topics like choosing future proof products (usability, security, etc..), dealing with contractors, keeping a happy spouse with ever changing automations and much more.
