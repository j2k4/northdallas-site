# {{ title }}

“IT by itself provides no value”. That’s a pretty bold statement and yet that’s where the winds of business are blowing. As a developer or IT professional you spend time understanding new languages and frameworks, but to deepen and broaden your impact, I recommend taking strides in understanding the business.

In this session we’ll focus on the business of software, from financial concepts, metrics, and the future of IT and enterprise architecture in the corporation. We’ll touch on why your CEO and VP may understand the role of technology more comprehensively than they’re given credit for.

As IT likely touches nearly all aspects of your company, going forward IT professionals will need to know more about business and the role IT plays in the broader organization. This session aims to better equip you to talk business with your company leaders or boss and to make yourself or your team more effective.

At Kid's Night this month we looked at commands and command blocks in Minecraft and a bit at redstone. For a synopsis and examples of what we covered, you can [take a look at Eric's blog post](http://ericsowell.com/blog/2015/9/4/nddnug-and-minecraft-command-blocks).

## [RSVP for Kids Here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/september-2015-nddnug-kids-night-tickets-18364330206)

**About Minecraft:** To be involved in this activity, your child needs to have a laptop which they can use with Minecraft installed on it and a Minecraft account. You can get all that setup at [https://minecraft.net/](https://minecraft.net/).

**Parents:** Parents may bring their kids but go in the main room and watch the adult presentation. However, unless you think your child can work independently on this in the kid's room, you should consider staying with them to help them out.

After this month we will begin working on projects that the kids can present to the parents and others. We haven't decided if we will take over the main meeting or have that presentation in the kids room though. Regardless, we figured this would be a good way to get the kids more actively involved in creating things.

Make sure to attend, because in addition to our awesome presenter, we have some way cool prizes!
