## Speaker Bio

Nathalie Goh-Livorness (no, that’s not a misspelling) grew up living around the world, and culminating her circumnavigation with graduating from USC with a degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering.

She has worked with many game developers, most notably credited on “World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria” while she was at Blizzard. She also worked in product development for Disney.com, responsible for the creating of movie, television and game websites.

Her passion for being in the gaming industry took hold, and she moved to Microsoft as a Gaming Evangelist in the Developer Experience and Evangelism division. Her day is filled leveraging her experience helping emerging independent game developers, guiding along technical and business hurdles to get their games successfully to market. She speaks all over the US, to students, game developers, and anyone else that will give her a stage. This includes many Unity development events, Women in Computing conferences, and too many game developer user groups to count.
