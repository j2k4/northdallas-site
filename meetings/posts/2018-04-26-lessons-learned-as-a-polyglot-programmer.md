# {{ title }}

We have entered the age of polyglot programming. It is no longer sufficient to know only C#, JavaScript, and SQL. Even if this wasn't the case, understanding the motivations and idioms of other languages will make you better in the language you primarily code in.

Amir will give you a tour of languages he has written production code in. He'll share what he's learned from these languages and how they've influenced how he writes C#/JavaScript. Amir will also share some tips on how to learn a new language so you can take the first steps to becoming a polyglot programmer.
