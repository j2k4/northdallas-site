# {{ title }}

Events are central to web programming for anything but the most trivial of web applications. In this Meetup we'll discuss topics such as how to use common events (e.g. click, touchstart), event capturing versus bubbling, event delegation, and discuss ideas on how we can use this knowledge to build interesting things.

This is an intermediate-level talk. All that you need to know is HTML and the basic ins-and-outs of JavaScript.
