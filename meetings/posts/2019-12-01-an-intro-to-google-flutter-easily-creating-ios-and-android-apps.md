# {{ title }}

Ever wanted to write mobile apps for iPhones and Android? Maybe you found Objective-C/Swift or Java/Kotlin intimidating? Or maybe you tried it with Xamarin but just thought it kind of meh? I feel you! It’s hard to get started. It’s confusing. Flutter fixes all of that.

Flutter is Google’s toolkit for creating apps for iOS and Android with a single codebase. It’s exploding, having just passed React Native in popularity. So we’ve decided to provide you a simple introduction to Flutter. Rap Payne, a professional developer and the author of a new book from Apress about Flutter ([bit.ly/flutter\_book](https://bit.ly/flutter_book)) will walk us through the basics of Flutter as we write a mobile app together.

In this first of two sessions, you will get a simple introduction to Flutter, an overview of exactly how it works, and a demo as we build an app together which you could actually run on your phone if you want to. You can either code along with Rap’s demo or you can sit back and watch.

Prior to the meeting, you can install Flutter on your machine to code along with Rap. Here are some instructions: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (Installation is the hardest part of Flutter. It’s all downhill from there). Rap will arrive early to help anyone who might be having setup/installation challenges. If you can’t get it set up, no problem. You can still observe and learn a ton.
