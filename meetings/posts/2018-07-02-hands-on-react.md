Want to learn [React](https://reactjs.org/)? In this meeting we'll have Part 1 of a series on learning this awesome JavaScript framework. This will be a hands-on activity, so bring your laptop and be ready to code. You should have some experience with JavaScript to benefit but otherwise there are no prerequisites other than bringing a laptop.

For the best development experience, you'll want to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If you have trouble getting any of that that installed, come about 45 minutes early and we'll help you get setup. You can use any text editor you want. If you only have a work laptop and can't get anything installed, we will have a web-browser-only option available for you.
