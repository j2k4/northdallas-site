<p>Have you ever been watching someone on YouTube coding in C# and been like ... you can do that?!  This session takes developers working day to day in C# and levels up their skills so they are truly ready for "end game content" of
 epicly hard problems.  We will show you how Records will change your data models forever, how Indices and Ranges can enable you to up your IPS (Instructions Per Second) by kicking LINQ to the curb for some things, and along the way we'll show you some of the
 very coolest cosmetic changes to the language.</p>
