AWS has been building out a large suite of libraries and tools to help .NET developers build and deploy .NET applications on AWS. This includes adding AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB to your applications as well as building modern serverless .NET applications using AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway. Let's discuss these libraries and tools and see how they can be used to build your .NET cloud application.
