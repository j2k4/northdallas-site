title: 'When Worlds Collide: Analog vs. Digital'

# {{ title }}

We live in a universe whose natural processes are analog; yet we choose to model those processes on digital computers. Does this make sense? If digital technologies are so great, why do we increasingly hide digital computation under fluid and bouncy user interfaces? If analog computers are so lame, why are they also so clever, so elegant, and so fascinating? Join [Charles Petzold](http://charlespetzold.com/ "Charles Petzold") in an exploration of the analog and digital computation of natural processes in an off-beat and thought-provoking presentation that connects Vannevar Bush's Differential Analyzer of the 1920s with Windows 8 and other modern user interfaces.
