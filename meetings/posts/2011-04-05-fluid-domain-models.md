[David O'Hara](http://blog.davidohara.net/ "David O'Hara") will discuss Fluid Domain Models.  
  
When is a person not a person? Or a thing not a thing? It depends. While this may sound like hyperbole, or a consultant's answer, there are ways we can address our need for context-specific views of a model without giving up our entire ecosystem. This approach is certainly no silver bullet but it does allow us to operate on our entities in ways that our current toolset would make very difficult. We will discuss document versus relational databases and how we can use interfaces and Castle's DictionaryAdapter to make our models fluid to the context in which they are operating without leaving us a puddle on the floor.

The meeting this month is at [Improving Enterprises](http://www.improvingenterprises.con "Improving Enterprises") in Addison, TX. Please see the sidebar for map information.

## Speaker Bio

Like every geek who grew up in the 80′s, David distinctly remembers getting his first computer – an Atari 800XL. It absorbed every ounce of free time, especially late at night, but taught him BASIC and the joys of creating things. After many years and several languages, he now spends most of his time working in .NET or Rails and has a special place for late night coding sessions and good scotch.

Since having an “agile awakening”, he has had a distinct need to grow in new directions and surround himself with smart people who will help him to shape this knowledge and practices. He has found [Improving Enterprises](http://www.improvingenterprises.com/ "It's what we do") to be a place filled with people who share similar ideas and values as well as his passion for learning and passing on that knowledge.

David is a regular speaker at user groups and code camps as well as an active member of several local groups, including [Dallas PragProg](http://wiki.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi/DallasPractitioners "Pragmatic Practitioners"), [Dallas .NET User Group](http://www.ddnug.net/ "The Dallas .NET User Group"), and the [Dallas User Experience](http://dnux.org "Dallas User Experience Group"). He also started the [Presenter Mentor](http://northdallas.net/meetings/fluid-domain-models/Presenter Mentor "Get Your Speak On!") group to help others get into technical presentations. Most recently he has begun several adventures into the world of entrepreneurship and is once again loving the highs (and lows) as well as the creation aspects of it. He is passionate about software craftsmanship, personal productivity, and getting things done. He was given the [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile/David "David O'Hara") (MVP) award for ASP.NET in 2009, 2010, and 2011.

Make sure to attend, because in addition to our awesome presenter, we have some way cool prizes!
