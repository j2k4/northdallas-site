With the release of the latest operating system, Windows Phone 7.5 now supports SQL Server CE as part of the Windows Phone runtime environment. Join Microsoft Developer Evangelist [Chris Koenig](https://twitter.com/#!/ChrisKoenig "Chris Koenig") for a tour of SQL Server CE Database Support on Windows Phone. We'll talk about defining, creating and accessing databases on the device, deploying databases with your application, and making updates to your database as you version your application.

The meeting this month is at [Improving Enterprises](http://www.improvingenterprises.con "Improving Enterprises") in Addison, TX. Please see the sidebar for map information.
