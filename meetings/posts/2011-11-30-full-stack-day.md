Building a dynamic website involves a number of different technologies, including some sort of database, some web application framework, html, css and javascript. Some developers are good at all of these but most are just familiar with a few (if any). Full Stack Day is here to give you guidance on getting started with all of these technologies. Comfortable with ASP.NETand Sql Server? Come get help with Html, Css and Javascript. You spend all day designing websites but don't know how to get started with the stuff that your developers use? Come get an introduction to ASP.NET MVC and Sql Server. Or are you a developer who hasn't used any of these? If you are, here is your chance to get a one-day exposure to the full stack.

For more information, [check out the Full Stack Day website](http://fullstackday.com/).

The meeting is at [Improving Enterprises](http://www.improvingenterprises.con "Improving Enterprises") in Addison, TX. Please see the sidebar for map information.
