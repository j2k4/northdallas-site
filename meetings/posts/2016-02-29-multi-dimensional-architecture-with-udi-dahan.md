**Note the date is the 9th and not the first Wednesday, the 3rd!!!!**

Despite the apparent evolution in the field of software architecture from Client-Server, to N-Tier, to SOA, and now to Microservices – there is a common flaw that has undermined the successful application of all of these styles for decades. There is a different approach, orthogonal to many of the buzzwords du jour, that can help you avoid falling into this trap. Join Udi for a multi-dimensional look at software architecture that just might leave you wishing you took the “blue pill” instead.
