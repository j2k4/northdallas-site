# {{ title }}

<p>Last year, I started implementing an unusual programming language from scratch, in TypeScript, for fun. It turned out kind of... weird! But along the way were lessons about why popular languages are designed the way that they are, and what we could do to design better ones. Plus, TypeScript tricks, JavaScript performance, and some tips on writing practical parsers.</p>
