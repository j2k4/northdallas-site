# {{ title }}

Please join us for a entertaining and interactive session! As always, we’ll have FREE food, drinks, and prizes for attending!

Please join us on September 2nd for a special event. We're pleased to welcome NorthDallas.net Officer, ASPInsider, and local database developer stud **Todd Carrico** who will lead us (and challenge us) through a deep-dive of practical usage of CodeSmith!

The templates that come with CodeSmith are cool, but what if you want it your way? After all, the CodeSmith promise is “your code, your way” This block of instruction will cover some techniques for creating your own CodeSmith templates.

-   Using database objects as metadata sources for making your own DTO’s  
    \*    You already have a hand coded pattern for DTO’s, and you don’t have time to learn an entire architecture.  
    \*    You just need a DTO your way but faster…  
     
-   Creating a template to turn table data into an Enum. - Who hasn’t needed one of these?
-   Scripting Data using the built in templates (Simple Backups, Moving a little bit of data from one server to the next, ...)
-   Tips for using CodeSmith.exe to help make your templates more useful.
-   \- You give me problem that you think might be solvable using code generation, and I try to point out how CodeSmith can be used to solve it.
