# {{ title }}

Please join us for a entertaining and interactive session! As always, we’ll have FREE food, drinks, and prizes for attending!

Please join us on July 8th (please note different date) for a special event. We're pleased to welcome Derick Bailey who will lead us through a code-heavy talk on great design practices with the S.O.L.I.D software design principle.

Almost every professional software developer understands the academic definitions of Coupling, Cohesion, and Encapsulation. However, many of us do not understand how to actually achieve Low Coupling, High Cohesion, and strong Encapsulation, as prescribed. Fortunately, there are a set of stepping stones that we can use to reach these end goals, giving us a clear cut path to software that is easier to read, easier to understand, and easier to change. This presentation will define not only the three object oriented goals, but also the five S.O.L.I.D. principle that lead us there, while walking through a sample application.
