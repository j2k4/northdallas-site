Mono is an open-source, cross-platform implementation of the .NET framework based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common Language Infrastructure. With Mono, users can run applications written and compiled in Visual Studio.NET on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Recently, the Mono project has found additional notoriety for projects such as Moonlight, the open-source implementation of Silverlight for Linux, and MonoTouch and MonoDroid, SDKs for building iPhone and Android applications with C#.

This session will provide an introduction to cross-platform development and deployment with Mono. Participants will see how they can leverage their existing skills and tools to write .NET applications that will run on multiple platforms and architectures with Mono. The presentation will also include a discussion of cross-platform considerations for leveraging Mono, demonstrate how to use MoMA, the Mono Migration Analyzer, to determine how ready an application is for cross-platform deployment. Additional demonstrations will examine how best to leverage Visual Studio to develop and deploy to Linux and OS X, and take a peek at the current state of iPhone and Android development with Mono.
