It is summer time and so it's the time for fun! We're going to keep the game dev fun going for another month. Join us if you can. This time, though, we're going to take advantage of the fact that we can use multiple rooms and have three game-related sessions going on at once.

First, **Summer and Allie will be helping people get started with Unity**. This is Unity 101. Beginners are welcome! Used by Pokemon GO, Monument Valley, and countless thousands of indie games, Unity is a game changer in the industry for people to create since 2005. In this session, you'll learn the basics of navigating Unity, writing scripts, and understanding how to work with the engine so you can create your own games!

If you would like to participate in this session, **YOU MUST DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL UNITY BEFORE ATTENDING** It is a big download, and our puny wifi is just not going to be able to handle it.

Second, **Amir and Eric will be helping people with DragonRuby**. DragonRuby is a, easy-to-install, easy-to-use, and extremely capable toolkit for making games. If you were here for last month's session, you will be joining Amir for a DragonRuby intermediate workshop. If you were not at the previous meeting, or if you want a repeat of the basics, you can join Eric in another room who will help you get started. Like last meeting, all attendees will be getting a free license to DragonRuby for attending.

Kids are welcome in this session, but parents and guardians are required to be present at all times. Depending on the age and computer-savvy of the child, the parent might need to help their child during the session.

## Speaker Bio

Summer has been programming for over ten years in a variety of languages and frameworks. She runs her own tech consulting and videogame business, organizes the non-profit Dallas Society of Play for game developers, and loves to inspire and share what she knows! She's a weirdo who types on a split Colemak keyboard and lives for cats, coffee, and code.

Allie is a programming enthusiast turned pro. Her programming experience started in Unity and C# and expanded to a handful of different languages and frameworks. Most of her spare time is spent working on her 3D printer while drinking tea, hanging out with friends, reading, and playing video games or the piano.

Amir is a hyper-polyglot with over fifteen years of industry experience. His expertise span multiple languages (C#, F#, JavaScript, Objective C, Clojure, C, Ruby) and multiple tech verticals (enterprise software development, compiler engineering, game development).

Eric is Director of Software Development for Muv, officer of this Users Group, and former coding instructor. He is the author of a mostly out-of-date book, Mobile ASP.NET MVC 5. When not coding, he likes to read, study history and dead languages, and play Minecraft with the kids.
