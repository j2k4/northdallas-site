## Speaker Bio

I am a solution architect at Praeses with 9 years of experience working on ASP.NET web applications spanning Web Forms, MVC, and Web API.

I co-lead the Red River .NET User Group in Shreveport, LA and also volunteer as an instructor at the local Girls Who Code chapter. I speak at local user groups and conferences and sporadically contribute to open source projects.

MinecraftU will be back to do ComputerCraft with us to help us teach kids to program with Minecraft. Please join us!

For your child to participate, they will need to have a laptop with Minecraft already installed. Ideally, they will be logged in and ready to go. Also, please bring $5 to pay for pizza.
