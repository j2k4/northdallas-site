With the popularization of the cloud and smart devices, software applications are becoming much more distributed. Relying on web services to provide access to your company information allows both internal and external applications to be built for a variety of platforms in a standardized fashion. Come learn how to design and build REST-based web services using Microsoft ASP.NET WebAPI. We'll start with the architecture of WebAPI and how to quickly create services and then jump into how to customize and secure those services all using web-based standards that any client can consume.
