Attendees at Wednesday's meeting (4 Jan 2012) have a chance at winning a Kinect!

This meeting is a code/markup/styling-heavy discussion of what you can do with Html 5 and Css 3 on mobile devices today. Bring your iPhones, Android phones, Windows Phone 7 phones, iPads, Android tablets et al. if you have them. Along with the code, we'll also talk a bit about what you can do to plan for devices whose browsers are not as advanced as others.

The meeting this month is at [Improving Enterprises](http://www.improvingenterprises.con "Improving Enterprises") in Addison, TX. Please see the sidebar for map information.
