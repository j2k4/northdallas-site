Unless you've been developing under a rock for the last year, you've no doubt heard people talking about the "cloud." But, what is the cloud and how can you take full advantage of it? Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform has made it incredibly simple for developers across a variety of platforms to build massively scalable, resilient solutions with minimal investment. In this session, Casey focuses specifically on Azure's storage capabilities including storing large, unstructured blobs of data, working with databases, relational or otherwise, and using Azure's powerful queueing mechanism. We will begin with a brief overview of the Azure platform, including general architecture and development environment setup. Next, we will take a deep dive into Azure's storage capabilities and, finally, we will wrap up the session by creating a few simple applications that demonstrate how to leverage these capabilities. Join us and learn how you can take advantage of the cloud in order to simplify the way that you build scalable applications.

The meeting this month is at [Improving Enterprises](http://www.improvingenterprises.con "Improving Enterprises") in Addison, TX. Please see the sidebar for map information.
