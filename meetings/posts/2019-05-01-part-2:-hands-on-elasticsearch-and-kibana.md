This is a hands-on exercise, so bring your laptop. You don't have to have anything installed.

If you did not come last time, there will be materials for you to work with, so don't feel like you can't come because you missed last time. Join us, eat some pizza, write some code, and network. If you did come last time, you will get more practice writing simple queries, but we will also get into aggregations, more Kibana visualizations, and other things.

Elasticsearch and Kibana are easily my most favorite tools that I've started using over the last year. I want to show you how to use them. Elasticsearch is an easy-to-use distributed full-text search and analytics engine. As you would imagine, you can write queries to put data in and queries to get data out. But you can also use Kibana, which is an awesome web frontend to Elasticsearch. And they are both easy to use. And we are going to learn a little bit more about them together.

If you want to [run Elasticsearch and Kibana locally, watch this video](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/nddg-vids/elasticsearch/elastic-getting-started.mp4). If you want [a short tour of Kibana, watch this video](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/nddg-vids/elasticsearch/elastic-intro-to-kibana.mp4).
