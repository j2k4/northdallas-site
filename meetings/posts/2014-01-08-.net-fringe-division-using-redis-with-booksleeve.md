# {{ title }}

StackExchange has done a great deal for the .NET community in the area of performance. In this session, we will be looking at their high performance client access library for Redis called Booksleeve using async/await. We will also be looking at the core concepts behind the in-memory data structure server Redis, and how it can fit into the architecture of a .NET web platform.
