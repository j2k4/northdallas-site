# {{ title }}

Your conscience: “You need to learn to write mobile apps already.”

You: “I know, I know! But it’s so hard and I don’t have the time”.

Also you: “If only there were a hands-on session with an instructor/author to walk me through it and provide live help.”

Flutter (from Google) enables you to create apps for iOS and Android with a single codebase. It's is exploding in popularity because of its elegance and ease of development. It’s the framework we’ve all been waiting for.

In this session, you will write a Flutter app that...

* runs truly natively on all iOS and Android devices
* interacts with the user
* consumes data from a public RESTful API
* presents that data as images to the user
* is responsive to different devices and rotations
* could be submitted to both the Apple AppStore and Google Play Store
* Your facilitator is Rap Payne, a professional developer and the author of a new book from Apress about Flutter.

Please bring your laptop so you can write code yourself (or pair with another dev whose laptop is ready to go). Between now and Wednesday you can install Flutter on your machine to code along with Rap. Here are some instructions: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install (Installation is the hardest part of Flutter. Development is much simpler). Rap will help anyone with setup/installation challenges via Slack and he’ll arrive early to the meeting.
