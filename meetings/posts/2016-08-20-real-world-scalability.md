# {{ title }}

As developers and architects, we talk about “scalable solutions”, but often fail to prove how well our solutions scale. Here, we will build a Web API on Microsoft Azure, and demonstrate how to implement more scalable applications, using async/await, distributed caching, and Azure auto-scaling. We will then prove how much more scalable our software is, using numbers from load tests.
