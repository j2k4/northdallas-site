Getting your app running with the basic data-bindings in place is only the first step. Aurelia provides the tools to create an experience your users will love, rather than just tolerate. Build a great data entry experience with Aurelia's powerful fluent validation plugin. Organize your code more effectively and consolidate shared behavior with custom components. Widen your audience by easily internationalizing your app. Enhance its appeal using animated transitions. Brian will cover all this and more in this intermediate Aurelia presentation.

## Speaker Bio

Brian Sullivan is a principal software engineer at Clear Measure in Dallas. He got his start in programming maintaining legacy mainframe applications in COBOL at a large trucking company, but quickly realized he needed to find a more productive environment in order to stay sane. He jumped at the opportunity to help transition some of those COBOL applications to .NET, and he hasnâ€™t looked back since. He has been working with Microsoft technologies since the .NET 1.0 days, and is interested in introducing modern web development techniques to the clients he works with. Brian is recipient of the Microsoft MVP award and a graduate of Harding University.
