Patterns talks tend to be abstract, academic discussions rather than real world examples but I'm not that kind of guy. This talk will cover techniques you can use to refactor your current code base to implement patterns and provide a more maintainable and testable solution. We'll do all of this using an actual working web application - no "Hello World" garbage here!

I have been a professional developer since the early 90's but currently find my home as a Senior Consultatnt for Improving Enterprises utilizing .NET. I’m familiar with all aspects of the Software Development Life Cycle and have an affinity for agile methodologies and techniques such as Scrum, XP and Test Driven Development. I’m a member of the Dallas PragProg User Group and Dallas .NET User Group as well as a speaker at various user groups and code camps. My passion for productivity leads me to find new ways to enhance and motivate myself and those around me. A “Getting Things Done” practitioner, I’m always looking for my “next action”.
