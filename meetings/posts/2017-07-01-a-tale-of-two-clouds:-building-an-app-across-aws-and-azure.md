# {{ title }}

Today's enterprise cloud consumers have a difficult decision to make when deciding where to deploy their application workloads: AWS, Azure or both? Both platforms share many similar services but have critical differences that are important to understand. More and more cloud consumers are looking to build applications that are 'cloud portable' due to a general 'fear of commitment' to one cloud platform over another and as part of a larger HA/DR strategy. This desire to embrace more than one cloud platform is one that, as trusted technical advisors, we cannot afford to ignore. In this session, geared specifically toward cloud architects, Casey Watson, Senior Program Manager​​ with the Azure Customer Advisory Team at Microsoft, discusses an approach to building complex, distributed applications that can be deployed to multiple cloud providers, take advantage of PaaS services and are easy to maintain. Casey will begin the session by discussing the key differences between the two cloud providers and offer some tips for having a multi-cloud conversation with your customers. Next, he will walk the audience through a multi-cloud architecture highlighting key platform differences then dive deep into Visual Studio to show how an actual, real-world solution would be implemented. Finally, Casey will review the deployment of a multi-cloud solution.
