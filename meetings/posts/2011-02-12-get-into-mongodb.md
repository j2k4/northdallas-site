# {{ title }}

David Penton will give an overview of the NoSQL movement and what it \*might\* mean for traditional database developers. What are folks really looking for with a NoSQL database? Then MongoDB installation, basic usage, and .NET drivers. Examples with NoRM will be used.

UPDATE! Presentation and project are linked [here](http://pentonizer.com/files/media/File/MongoDBAndNoRM.zip).

 The meeting this month is not at Intuit and also not at the Parr library, as we had planned for the previous meeting. [This month's meeting is at the Harrington library](http://plano.gov/Departments/Libraries/About%20the%20Library/Pages/harrington.aspx).
