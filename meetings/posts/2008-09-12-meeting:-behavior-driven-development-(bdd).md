BDD is driven by business value!   The practices of BDD include:

-   Driving development from the outside-in
-   Using examples to describe the behavior of the application, or of units of code
-   Automating those examples to provide quick feedback and regression testing
-   Using 'should' to help drive out responsibility and allow the behavior to be questioned
-   Using 'ensure' to differentiate between outcomes which are the responsibility of the code in question, and those caused by other elements of code as a side-effect
-   Using mocks to stand-in for modules of code which have not yet been written

After years and years of practicing and learning TDD, there is a revolution going on towards BDD, Behavior Driven Design. In this session, we will look at how BDD improves on the concepts of TDD, helps write better tests and makes you think more thoroughly through the problem you are attempting to solve. We will be replacing what you know about fixtures and tests with concepts such as contexts and specifications, concerns and observations and how to organize your specifications and use [specunit](http://code.google.com/p/specunit-net/) to introduce better language into your tests and build specification reports. We do all of this in C# and Visual Studio 2008.
