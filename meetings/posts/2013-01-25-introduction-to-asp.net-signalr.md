As the internet involves, the speed of delivering content from servers to clients finds more importance day after day. Real-time communication between servers and clients has become a very important part of many internet websites that increases the level of communication between sites with users as well as users with users. This problem has been common enough that there are several real-time communication frameworks introduced to handle asynchronous message delivery from the servers to the clients. Microsoft is not an exception when it comes to this field and it has released ASP.NET SignalR framework for .NET developers as an open source project to enable real-time communications in their ASP.NET applications using WebSockets or long-polling connections. ASP.NET SignalR 1.0 was the first version of this project that was introduced as a built-in part of ASP.NET in Fall 2012 Update in BUILD conference.

In this talk, we go over the main features of ASP.NET SignalR and how to get started with this framework.

The meeting this month is at [Improving Enterprises](http://www.improvingenterprises.con "Improving Enterprises") in Addison, TX. Please see the sidebar for map information.
