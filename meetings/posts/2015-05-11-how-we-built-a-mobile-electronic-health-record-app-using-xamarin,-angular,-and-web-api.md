\------------------

Learn how our team built a cross-platform mobile electronic health record (EHR) app from scratch in less than a year using Xamarin, Angular, and Web API.

Discover the reason we chose the mix of technologies (Xamarin, Angular, Web API) we did.

You will get an overview of the implementation of the entire application from the front end to the back end. There will be plenty of app demos and code samples.

What will be covered:

-   The best way to build a cross-platform app
-   How we combined native Xamarin UI elements with Angular based web views
-   Our custom JavaScript bridge used to communicate between Angular and Xamarin
-   Lessons learned about cross-platform app development
-   Automated E2E testing on devices using Xamarin Test Cloud
-   Back end implementation using ASP.NET Web API modules

## Speaker Bio

Matt’s passion is building things. He started programing on an Atari 400 when he was 11. After graduating from A&M with a degree in Electrical Engineering, he spent 5 years in the semiconductor industry before returning to software. He’s cofounded 3 software companies. One resulted in a decent exit. The other two were “learning experiences.” In all 3 companies Matt was responsible for the software design and wrote a lot of the code himself. He is currently in charge of mobile application development at Aprima where his team is building a cross-platform mobile electronic medical record app. Matt has a website at [www.mattspradley.com](http://www.mattspradley.com).
