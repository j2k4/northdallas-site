title: Up and running with React in ASP.NET

# {{ title }}

React is a JavaScript library for building modern user interfaces. It's often used in a node-based stack, but needn't be. You can build your next feature in React in your existing ASP.NET MVC application seamlessly. This approach lets you experiment with the popular and powerful new framework without scrapping your existing application. It also allows you to use the existing strongly typed toolset in Visual Studio to maintain your data contracts, and avoid the fragility of plain JavaScript. We'll use TypeScript and Visual Studio 2015 to build an interactive app quickly. We'll look at the Flux architecture pattern, and what it looks like in a strongly typed environment. We won't need to install Node.

This is an intermediate-level talk. All you need to know is a bit of ASP.NET MVC, and be curious about how it works with React.

To follow along with the live coding portion, have Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 installed and run the following:

\`git clone https://github.com/mikerandrup/AlienPeriodicTable\`

As we live code, the project will be deployed to http://nddnug-demo.azurewebsites.net at milestones during the presentation. This is the starting point project for the live coding portion, and also a good base for any fun with React/Flux with TypeScript in ASP.NET later on.

## Speaker Bio

Mike just wrapped up 5 years as a Software Engineer at Match.com on their mobile web product. That included applying modern web technologies like React. He's also spent time at a green building startup that decided to rewrite everything in plain JavaScript and React.

He is currently investing the first half of 2017 to specialize in 3D Graphics Software Engineering going forward. This includes an ambitious dose of learning, and building a portfolio of personal projects including a 3D iOS game to be released around the end of Q2 2017. When not coding, he loves listening to audiobooks, avoiding long road trips, and hosting an assortment of Airbnb guests.
