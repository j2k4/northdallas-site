# {{ title }}

Want to write your first cross-platform mobile application? Join us to learn how to write a mobile application using C# with Xamarin.Forms. Bring your laptop and follow along whether you are using Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac. I will take you through the basics of creating a collection view with data pulled from a real API. We will cache images and pull in NuGet packages. You will walk away with a working knowledge of Xamarin.Forms application development.

C# is a great language for writing mobile applications. Anything you can do in Java and Kotlin, you can do in C#. You will be able to create a native mobile application and use all of the Native API's including calling Java and Kotlin code from your C#.
