When Amir was a kid, his first introduction to programming was through building games using VB6. You may have a similar story of coding for the first time, making some form of digital interactive media.

And like the story usually goes, we eventually have to grow up. We find that becoming successful with arts and technology is hard, so we end up applying our creativity to building enterprise software instead.

Well, how about we let our hair down and reconnect with our inner child? Just bring a laptop, open mind, and let's have some fun hacking on cross-platform games using Ruby!

This is a kid-friendly/beginner-friendly session. Everyone that attends will get a free license to the game engine Amir will be using during the hands-on workshop: [DragonRuby Game Toolkit (http://dragonruby.org)](http://dragonruby.org).
