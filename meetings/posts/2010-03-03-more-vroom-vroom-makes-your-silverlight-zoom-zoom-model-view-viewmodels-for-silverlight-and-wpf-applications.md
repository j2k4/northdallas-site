# {{ title }}

As a follow up to Dependency Injection with Silverlight, this talk focuses on the advanced data binding and application modeling options that are available so that you can achieve a higher level of maintainability, functionality and testability in the UI layer of your application. ViewModels are the natural progression of MVC and MVP patterns in your application design. The concepts that are introduced will also help you to have a better level of separation between your development and designer teams, reducing the dependencies on each other and achieve a higher level of productivity.
