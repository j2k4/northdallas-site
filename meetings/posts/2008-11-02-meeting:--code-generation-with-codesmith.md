I have said that nothing is cooler than code that writes code.

This session is going to be a deep dive into the CodeSmith templates that Match.com uses to solve various business problems. We'll cover some of the normal uses for code generation such as the DAL, but we'll also dive into how we used CodeSmith to help us out with our massively distributed data architecture.

We'll look at some of the templates we use as helpers, and finish with templates we use to generate our search algorithm. We won't go into the gory details of the algorithm but we will talk about how CodeSmith has enabled us to create a maintainable and flexible solution to this huge problem.
