As developers, it is easy to become overwhelmed by the amount of new information in our field that we think we need to learn. What usually causes us to be overwhelmed is that we don’t have a clear idea of where we want to go. Maybe we don’t have to learn three new client side JavaScript frameworks if we really want to go into machine learning.

By the end of this session you will leave with a clear and defined goal, a path to get to that goal, and some techniques to help you down the path.

This session is interactive. Pencils and paper will be provided.
