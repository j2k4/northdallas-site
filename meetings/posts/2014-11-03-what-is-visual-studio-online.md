# {{ title }}

Officially launched in 2013, Visual Studio Online is, in Microsoft's own words, "a collection of developer services that runs on Windows Azure and extends the developer experience in the cloud." That sounds awesome but what does it actually mean? Is it XBOX Live for Visual Studio? Not quite. In this hands-on session, Casey guides the audience through an example project covering Visual Studio Online's four core features - source control (via Git), agile planning, automated builds and application insights. At the end of the session you will know all that you need to start using Visual Studio Online on your next major project. If you wish to follow along live, don't forget to bring your laptop with Visual Studio 2013 installed and sign up for your free (forever) Visual Studio Online account at [http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-online-user-plans-vs.aspx](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-online-user-plans-vs.aspx).

## Speaker Bio

A native of Fort Worth, Texas, Casey Watson is a Senior Program Manager in the Developer Experience group at Microsoft, dedicated husband and proud father. Casey believes that is the responsibility of every serious developer to constantly "sharpen their saw" through both reading and community involvement and is a strong advocate of SOLID development practices. Over the last ten years, he has been focused primarily on the .NET platform but has recently taken a keen interest in cloud architecture and development. Casey is heavily involved in the local development community having spoken at several user groups and conferences across the South Central region of the United States including Cowtown Code Camp, Dallas Tech Fest and Tulsa Tech Fest and is an active open source contributor ([http://github.com/caseywatson](http://github.com/caseywatson)). When not learning about, speaking on, writing about or building software, he can be found spending time with his family, updating his Twitter status (@\_caseywatson), or enjoying an ice cold bottle of Blue Moon.
