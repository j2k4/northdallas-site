[Chander Dhall](http://twitter.com/#!/csdhall "Chander Dhall") will discuss Algorithms and Patterns in C#, .NET  
  
Why are right algorithms and patterns are so vital to the robustness of your application? Why do software projects fail due to lack of focus on some of these basics? New patterns come out every day - do I have to know them? When to use and when not to use a pattern? Microsoft takes care of a lot of this for us so why should we bother with algorithms?  
  
Come to this perspective talk to understand the importance of right patterns and right practices for enterprise software development. This talk focuses on 'not so widely known patterns' and assumes you know the widely used patterns like factory, strategy etc. If time permits Chander Dhall would like to have a discussion over web performance, too.

The meeting this month is at [Improving Enterprises](http://www.improvingenterprises.con "Improving Enterprises") in Addison, TX. Please see the sidebar for map information.
