There are several external caching engines that are available. Now Microsoft is busy developing their own caching engine called "Velocity". This promises to provide the ability for application developers to horizontally scale their applications across numerous servers by providing unified cache across all application instances. This presentation will give an overview of "Velocity", the basics of requirements & installation, and an explanation of the basic areas of interest within "Velocity" such as Named Caches, Regions and Cache Items. The samples in this demonstration include code for accessing cache, and how this can integrate with the ASP.NET cache.
