title: The Fundamentals of Functional Programming

# {{ title }}

The world operates in functions. Everyday we perform numerous small tasks that lead to some kind of output. That output is then used as an input to another task to produce a different output. Functional Programming is the practice of slicing a problem into smaller consumable units of work so that the connections of inputs to outputs can be pictured simply.

We will explore the fundamentals of thinking as a Functional Programmer, introduce key concepts of the F# language, code an F# solution quickly, and refactor for beautification and simplicity.

## Speaker Bio

Jeremy Bellows is a F# developer working at Match.com. He enjoys learning new languages and concepts, and has published mobile applications. When he is not programming he is reading books or playing guitar.

MinecraftU will be back to help us learn how to program in Minecraft using the ComputerCraft mod. We'll split the group up so those who haven't been to our previous meetings can get help getting started.

**Note:** For your child to participate, they will need a laptop with Minecraft installed and a Minecraft account. We do not have extra laptops to use or free licenses to Minecraft, so come prepared!
