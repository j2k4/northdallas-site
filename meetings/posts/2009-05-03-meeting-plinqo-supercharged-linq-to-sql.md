Please join us for a entertaining and interactive session! As always, we’ll have FREE food, drinks, and prizes for attending!

Please join us on May 6th for a special event. Shannon Davidson & Tom Dupont from CodeSmith will lead a code-heavy discussion around the PLINQO project - focused on "supercharging" LINQ to SQL.

**Everyone in attendance will receive a fully-licensed copy of CodeSmith Professional 5.0, so please [RSVP NOW](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/338760241)! Seating is limited.**

In the time that LINQ to SQL has been available, we have been identifying ways to make LINQ to SQL better. We have compiled all of those cool tips and tricks including new features into a set of CodeSmith templates. PLINQO opens the LINQ TO SQL black box giving you the ability to control your source code while adding many new features and enhancements. It's still LINQ to SQL, but better!
