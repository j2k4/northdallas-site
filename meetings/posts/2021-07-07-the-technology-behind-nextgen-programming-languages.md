<p>What is a language spec? What is a runtime? What do languages like C#, Ruby, Swift, Objective-C, and Rust have in common? How are they developed to work across the diverse hardware of 2020? What exactly is a programming language?</p>

<p>Amir will give you a tour of this "other world" and hopefully shed light on all the work that goes into making Console.WriteLine("Hello World"); print to the screen.</p>
