title: 'Dynamic Features of C# 4 with Aaron Erickson'

# {{ title }}

Do you remember when generics were introduced in the .NET runtime 2.0? That was the the biggest new feature in that version of the framework and it's almost 5 years old. Time for a new runtime release with new and exciting features.  
In this talk, we focus on the only new feature in C# 4 that really matters — the dynamic keyword. There are some new, amazing possibilities that, previously, were only elegantly achievable with dynamic languages like JavaScript and Ruby. We will touch on ways that using dynamic can change the way that you code, including things like a true ActiveRecord pattern, Expando objects, and more.
