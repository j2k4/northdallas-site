# {{ title }}

CSS Layout can be a bit difficult at times, but with a little guided practice you can learn the principles and start effectively using CSS to layout your web pages today. And in this session, guided practice is exactly what we are going to do. This is a hands-on activity, so bring you computer. Be ready to code. You will be able to do all the exercises in your browser, so you don't need to install anything.

It is common to use CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) to do page layout. In this session we won't be using CSS frameworks. We'll be learning the CSS that CSS frameworks use to make layouts. Even if you want to use these frameworks, learning the underlying CSS principles will help you use them more effectively.
