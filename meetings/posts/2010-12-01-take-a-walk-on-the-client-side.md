As .NET developers we usually spend the bulk of our time slinging C#/VB.NET code and writing Sql with little focus on the client-side of the web. In this session, David Penton and Eric Sowell will talk about client-side techniques involving Html 5, Css, Javascript (and some jQuery) that you can use when working on your websites. _**Some**_ of the topics include the following:

-   The problems with table layout
-   Positioning with floats
-   Css inheritance
-   Some useful things in Html 5
-   How to use Fiddler
-   How to use the IIS SEO Toolkit
-   Client-side templating
-   How to use ySlow
-   Css Hacks
-   Progressive enhancement
-   et al...
