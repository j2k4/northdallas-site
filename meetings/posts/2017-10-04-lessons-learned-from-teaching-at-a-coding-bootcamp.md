title: Lessons Learned from Teaching at a Coding Bootcamp

# {{ title }}

If you have ever considered teaching at a coding bootcamp, pondered starting one, or have wondered if hiring a graduate is a good idea, come for the discussion and bring your questions. For the last year and a half I've taught at a coding bootcamp called The Iron Yard. As you may have heard, The Iron Yard is shutting down and I am (obviously) on my way out and making the switch back to being a full-time developer. Now at the end, I can say that it was a difficult but rewarding experience and I have learned much that I could never have learned otherwise. I'm going to talk about some of the things I've learned about coding bootcamps and teaching. Some of my assumptions before taking on the role were quite wrong and I am happy to share what I learned.

## Speaker Bio

Eric Sowell is an instructor for The Iron Yard in Dallas (for now) and helps people change careers and become web developers. When Eric is programming, he enjoys server-side development and database work but prefers to live on the client-side, doing either iOS app or web development. He is the author of a partially out-of-date book, Mobile ASP.NET MVC 5 (http://www.amazon.com/Mobile-ASP-NET-MVC-Eric-Sowell/dp/1430250569/ref=sr\_1\_1).

When not coding, he likes to read, study history and dead languages, and play Minecraft with the kids.
