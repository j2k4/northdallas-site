# {{ title }}

There is always something to learn about GIT, whether you are new to it or have been using it for many years. Amir will facilitate a workshop to show how to effectively use git. More importantly, he will share with you his generalized philosophy with regards to source control, and hopefully provide a unique perspective that will set you on a path of growth.

To participate in this activity, you will need to bring your laptop and have GIT installed. If you need help installing GIT, please come a little early and we can help.

**Note: Due to lack of interest, we will not be doing the make up session for Hands-On React Part 2.**
