Scrum is the most popular Agile framework in the world for effective team collaboration on complex projects. Scrum provides a small set of rules that create just enough structure for teams to be able to focus their innovation. Scrum is optimized for teams for teams of 5 to 9 people. Making Scrum work with larger teams or in large enterprise environments brings its own set of challenges. This talk presents 3 patterns used on enterprise teams to scale Scrum effectively with global teams. We will primarily focus on the "Product Owner Team" model and how it can be used with your teams. Learning Objectives: · Learn the key elements of the Scrum Framework and how it drives success in building software · Discover Scrum’s limitations in large organizations and how they can be over overcome · Explore 3 non-exclusive and interworking organizational patterns that your teams can adopt to gain the benefits of scrum while scaling to larger development and product groups.
