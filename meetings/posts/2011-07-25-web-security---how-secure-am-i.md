[David Penton](http://pentonizer.com/ "David Penton") will discuss Web Security - How Secure Am I?  
  
David Penton will go over features and function of ASP.NET web security but explains how that only gets you so far, realizing that traditional security measures only provide a foundation. Learn the top flaws which include cross site scripting and popular forms of injection to watch out for and ways to mitigate those flaws in your day to day development.
