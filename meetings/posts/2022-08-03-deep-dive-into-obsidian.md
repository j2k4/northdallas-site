# {{ title }}

I love [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). What is it? It's one of those "second brain" kinds of tools, and I'm using it for general knowledge management and research, as well as for managing tasks work projects. You don't have to be a developer to use it (so feel free to invite less nerdy folks), but I think it has a special appeal for our developer brains. Also, developers can write plugins for the tool, which we'll discuss.

What will we cover?

* Obsidian basics
* Using plugins
* How to manage life and work
* How to do knowledge management for books notes or study
* For the developers, how to create plugins using Typescript/JS

Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (it's free) and bring your laptop so you can try things out during the presentation.
