# {{ title }}

<p>For the past three months I've been involved in leading an accelerator program (with a lot of help) for learning .NET Development, Microsoft Dynamics, the Dataverse, and the Power Platform. I've been in and around the .NET and Microsoft development community since 2003, but this exposed me to a set of Microsoft products with which I had no experience.</p>

<p>In this meeting, I'm going to walk you through what I've learned about this ecosystem of tools, give some demos, and talk a bit about software development in this world.</p>

<p><em>NOTE</em>: This meeting will be in-person at Improving for all those who want to join us. We'll also stream through Zoom as usual, but if you would prefer to see people in real life, feel free to join us. But by joining us in-person, you acknowledge that you take the risk on yourself re: COVID of meeting in person. Please see this note from our location sponsor.</p>
