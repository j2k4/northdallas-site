While most enterprise applications are object-oriented, the data upon which they depend is not. Today, binding these two platforms together results in a significant amount of lost productivity as well as a less than optimal solution. Come and take a detailed look at the “LINQ Project “ to see what Microsoft is doing to help bridge the mismatch between OO and relational data. We will take a close look at the following areas:

-   How LINQ manifests a move from an imperative to a declarative style of programming.
-   New language and framework extensions that provide a single, unified approach to querying data.
-   Examples of querying data from multiple data domains: In-memory, database, ADO.NET constructs and XML documents.
-   A look at the upcoming Microsoft Entity Framework.
-   How LINQ might fit into a multi-tiered application.

Be prepared for a solid overview with lots of code examples.
