# {{ title }}

Features like async/await have often taken the spotlight away from other features in C# that are a lot more important for developer efficiency and productivity. This talk will be diving into some of the lesser-known features in C#, a language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative and is now a multi-paradigm standardized modernized language. Since its inception, C# has added over 50 features and continues to add more. Join us and sharpen your C# skills.

Please be sure to come with Visual Studio 2017 or 2015 or Xamarin Studio installed and ready to run. This talk will be an interactive workshop.
