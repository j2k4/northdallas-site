As developers, we all have our favorite utilities, some used occasionally and then there are others that we refuse to work without. We might not use all of them everyday, but a good developer should know his options when the need arises. In this session, we'll go through the tools, utilities and hacks that can make you much more productive as a .Net developer.

The meeting this month is at [Improving Enterprises](http://www.improvingenterprises.con "Improving Enterprises") in Addison, TX. Please see the sidebar for map information.
