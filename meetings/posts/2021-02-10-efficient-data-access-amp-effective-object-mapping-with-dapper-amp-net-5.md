# {{ title }}

<p>Growing tired of re-creating the tedious CRUD and results to object mapping logic for each database entity?  Does your modern application require integration with an existing robust databases?  Do you work with a DBA team that mandates use of stored procedures for abstraction &amp; performance tuning? Need to write a utility or service to process large amounts of records as quickly as possible?  Then the leading micro-ORM, Dapper, might be the data access &amp; object-mapping solution for you.</p>
<p>I was inspired to create this talk after migrating to Dapper reduced windows service processing times from hours to seconds. My goals for this session are to</p>
<ul>
    <li>Introduce Dapper as an effective and efficient data access &amp; object mapping solution</li>
    <li>Articulate best fit scenarios,</li>
    <li>Provide you with code examples and resources to empower you to explore use of Dapper in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>In this session, we will introduce Dapper as an effective and efficient way to access your SQL data, in the context of ORMs vs micro-ORMs. After reviewing which usage scenarios allow Dapper to shine, we will perform deep-dive with code examples into common usage scenarios and advanced topics (transactions, sharing database connections with multiple commands, multiple result set mapping, and more).</p>
