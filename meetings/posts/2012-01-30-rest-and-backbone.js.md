[Amir Rajan](http://twitter.com/#!/amirrajan "Amir Rajan") will discuss REST and BackBone.js  
  
Amir Rajan will show you how to use REST architectures in conjunction with BackBone.js, a client side MVC framework. He'll discuss what it really means to have a REST service (no, it's not just returning JSON to the client) and show you how a REST api can be used to develop single page applications using BackBone.js.

The meeting this month is at [Improving Enterprises](http://www.improvingenterprises.con "Improving Enterprises") in Addison, TX. Please see the sidebar for map information.
