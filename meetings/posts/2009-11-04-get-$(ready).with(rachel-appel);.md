jQuery aims to redefine the way we write JavaScript, and now with support built into Microsoft Visual Studio, you can more easily write client-side scripts than ever before. In this session, you will learn the basics of jQuery starting with downloading and installing jQuery. We'll then move onto topics such as unobtrusive JavaScript, using jQuery wrapped sets and selectors, creating animations, and common scripting tasks.
