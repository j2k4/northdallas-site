This month we are once again hosting two events, one for adults, and one for kids. Both will involved the micro:bit. The micro:bit is a business card sized computer. This tiny computer will allow you to learn how code while having tons of fun. The micro:bit allows for block-based coding with which you can program LEDs, robots, and so much more. You can purchase a micro:bit from [Amazon](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B01G8X7VM2/) or from [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com/product/3362).

Ron DagDag is going to lead a session about web usb, web midi, and web bluetooth. This will then be followed by a workshop on how to connect micro:bits to the browser via web bluetooth. Ever want to interact with devices on the Web? We'll look how the chrome browser allows us to connect to usb, bluetooth, midi devices. We will explore what webUSB, webMIDI and webBluetooth API and how it expose device services to the web. Attend this workshop and let's connect some hardware to browser by using micro:bits via web bluetooth using micro:bits via web bluetooth. You do not have to buy a micro:bit for this session, but you are encouraged to do so.

Sean Sparkman will be leading a session for the kids. In this session, we will learn the basics of block-based coding. We will write text to LEDs on the micro:bit and play sounds. Finally, we will build a friend detector that you can wear on your wrist. You will need to bring your own micro:bit, but you will be able to take it home to write your own programs and experiment!

For your child to participate, **you need the following**:

-   A micro:bit (purchase from [Amazon](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B01G8X7VM2/) or from [Adafruit](https://adafruit.com/product/3362))

Parents with younger children will need to attend the kids workshop to help their child. You are also not allowed to leave the building and leave your child unattended.
