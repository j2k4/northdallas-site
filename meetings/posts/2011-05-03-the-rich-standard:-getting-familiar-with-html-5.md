[Todd Anglin](http://weblogs.asp.net/toddanglin/ "Todd Anglin") will discuss Getting familiar with HTML 5.  
  
HTML 5 may take some time to find full support in all major browsers, but you may be surprised to discover how many of HTML 5’s features are available today! HTML 5 is the next generation standard for web applications, and it promises to give plug-in based RIAs, like Silverlight, a serious challenge. In this demo heavy session, you’ll see HTML 5 in action and learn what you can do with today’s browser support for the new standard. You’ll also see how HTML5 compares to the latest features in Silverlight 5. If you’re building rich web applications and you’ve never touched HTML 5, this session is a must see.

The meeting this month is at [Improving Enterprises](http://www.improvingenterprises.com "Improving Enterprises") in Addison, TX. Please see the sidebar for map information.
