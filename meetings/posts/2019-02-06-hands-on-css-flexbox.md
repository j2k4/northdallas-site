# {{ title }}

In the last meeting we practiced CSS layout, discussed how the display property works, and learned how to use floats effectively. In this session we will discuss Flexbox, a newer way to do CSS layout. This is a hands-on activity, so bring you computer. Be ready to code. In the first part of the session we will learn how Flexbox works. In the second part we will practice by replicating examples we find on the web. You will be able to do all the exercises in your browser, so you don't need to install anything, though working in a text editor is great as well.

It is common to use CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) to do page layout. In this session we won't be using CSS frameworks. We'll be learning the CSS that CSS frameworks use to make layouts. Even if you want to use these frameworks, learning the underlying CSS principles will help you use them more effectively.
