Part 1: Git 101

Git is everywhere. It’s the way we share code. It’s the way we contribute to open source projects. During workshops, we use Git to share source code.

Tim Rayburn knows Git. He loves Git. He teaches developers how to use Git almost every day. Tim will explain the advantages of a local repository. He will explain branching, merging, and rebasing, and what makes Git different from other version control systems

Part 2: Bridge all the things

You’ve learned enough about your current project’s Version Control System to use it, but you’re changing projects. Now what? In part 2, Cori Drew will expand on Tim’s git 101 talk by explaining why git really is a swiss army knife of all coding situations, but will focus on the git-tfs bridge.

The git-tfs bridge enables the best of both worlds: TFS for devs who (like I used to say) "have no interest in learning a command-line tool," while enabling those of us who have seen git solve version control challenges previously assumed unsolvable, to use our new git love.

Come out, Wednesday night, and learn this ubiquitous and universally useful tool.
