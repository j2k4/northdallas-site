# {{ title }}

NHibernate has always been preferred ORM tool for DDD community in .NET land. However one area of NHibernate where people struggled most is its xml base configuration. This is where Fluent NHibernate was born giving Fluent, XML-less, compile safe, automated, convention-based mappings for NHibernate. Rather than writing XML documents, you write mappings in strongly typed C# code. This allows for easy refactoring, improved readability and more concise code.

In this session of "Journey to Fluent NHibernate", we will take deep dive into real life usage of fluent NHibernate. Starting from where to find it, session will proceed with covering topic like how to configure NHibernate, where and how to define mapping and how to make sure our mapping is correct by mean of mapping test.
