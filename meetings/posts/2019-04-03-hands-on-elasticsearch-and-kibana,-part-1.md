title: 'Hands-On Elasticsearch and Kibana, Part 1'

# {{ title }}

Elasticsearch and Kibana are easily my most favorite tools that I've started using over the last year. I want to show you how to use them. Elasticsearch is an easy-to-use distributed full-text search and analytics engine. As you would imagine, you can write queries to put data in and queries to get data out. But you can also use Kibana, which is an awesome web frontend to Elasticsearch. And they are both easy to use.

This is a hands-on exercise, so bring your laptop. Within five minutes you will be writing queries and seeing how it works first-hand. If you want to get Elasticsearch and Kibana running on your own laptop, some instructions will be provided in the meeting. I will also provide some simple code samples in multiple languages (C#, Python, and JavaScript) for you to try out.

You are not required to have any previous experience with Elasticsearch. In this session we will focus on the basics of inserting data, querying it, and visualizing it using Kibana.
