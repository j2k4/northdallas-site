# {{ title }}

Responsive single page web applications are becoming the norm instead of the exception. Given this shift in web app development, quite a few client side frameworks written in JavaScript have emerged. Amir will give you the run down on the most popular frameworks (Backbone, Knockout and Angular to name a few). He'll also shed some light on how your server side code (and mindset) needs to change to better support clients written in dynamic/prototypical languages.
