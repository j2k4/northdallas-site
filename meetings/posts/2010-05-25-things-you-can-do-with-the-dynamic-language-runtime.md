# {{ title }}

The Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) came out in version 1.0 with the release of .NET 4 but most developers don't know it is there and, if they do, don't know what you can do with it. In this talk we will discuss what the DLR is and, through looking at the plethora of things you can do with it, get a taste for things the DLR allows us as developers to do with it. Many have heard of the Python and Ruby support but this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. So come join us for a discussion of the many things you can do with the Dynamic Language Runtime.
