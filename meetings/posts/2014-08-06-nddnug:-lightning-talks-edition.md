**Amir Rajan** is a pretty decent dev and is constantly trying to improve in his craft. He's a jack of all trades, being comfortable with a number of platforms and languages. He strives to better the community through open source contributions, mentoring, and blogging.

As far as his rap sheet is concerned:

Amir is a seasoned presenter, an ASP.NET Insider, and has had appearances on various podcasts (Hanselminutes, Herding Code, and .Net Rocks). He is also the creator of A Dark Room iOS. This minimalist text based RPG conquered the world and took the #1 spot in the App Store across 5 countries. The game has received critical acclaim from Dallas Morning News, CBS 11 DFW, Paste Magazine, Giant Bomb, Forbes, The Huffington Post, Cult of Mac, and The New Yorker. Last but certainly not least. Amir strives to be like Eric Sowell.

**Mike Randrup** has been intensely geeky about computer graphics and programming since 1993. In addition to a decade of building complex custom web projects for DFW businesses, he had a prior life creating 3D animation for broadcast TV and Playstation game cinematics. Currently he is User Interface & .NET Application Engineer on the mobile web team at Match.com, and very excited about HTML5's capabilities.

**Eric Sowell** manages the mobile web development efforts of Match.com. These days he also dabbles in iOS development, draws a lot and definitely plays too much Minecraft. He is the recent author of Mobile ASP.NET MVC 5 with Apress. You can see his occasionally updated website at http://ericsowell.com and can follow him on Twitter (@mallioch). His current goal in life is to have a #1-ranked paid app in the iOS app store like Amir Rajan.

Make sure to attend, because in addition to our awesome presenter, we have some way cool prizes!
