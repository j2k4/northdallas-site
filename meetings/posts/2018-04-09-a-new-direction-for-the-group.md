# {{ title }}

The North Dallas .NET Users Group is going through big changes in format and focus. We announced them at the April meeting and [have posted the big ideas up on our about page](../../about-us/index.html). In short, we're going to change the way that we learn together, we're going to broaden the scope of the technologies we teach, we're going to providing training to those who are interested in teaching and writing, and we'll even be changing our name. If you are interested in hearing more about the changes or (even better) want to get involved, please join us for this meeting.
