# {{ title }}

Mobile web development is becoming more important and even though most of what works in "normal" web development works on mobile, there are unique challenges and constraints to it that we need to be aware of. During this meeting we will be discussing these challenges and how we can meet them in the context of ASP.NET MVC 4. Topics will include but will not be limited to the following:

-   New features in ASP.NET MVC 4
-   Handling devices with drastically different capabilities
-   Optimizing performance for the mobile web
-   Device and feature detection and the limitations of both

If you have particular questions before that you would like answered, you can tweet them to Eric at [@mallioch](http://twitter.com/mallioch).

## Speaker Bio

Eric Sowell develops mobile web things for Match.com. He was the development lead on the mobile web platform (which was cool) until recently when Shane Henderson forced him to become "Manager of Web Applications." So now he speaks as much as he can before he loses all technical ability and just knows how to write Excel macros, create Powerpoint presentations and schedule meetings. You can follow him on Twitter (@mallioch) and find out more about him at [http://ericsowell.com](http://ericsowell.com).

Make sure to attend, because in addition to our awesome presenter, we have some way cool prizes!
