  JavaScript

# {{ title }}

A solid REST API is essential to any modern web application. Yet a REST API alone is of little value. We are going to walk through an example of how to use ASP.NET MVC and Inversion of Control (IoC) to create a framework for delivering a sustainable REST API. Then, we will demonstrate a JavaScript pattern for consuming the API to enable rich user experiences in the browser. All you need to bring is your brain. Let's have a conversation.
