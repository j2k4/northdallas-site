# {{ title }}

Many developers have built queue-based systems before - whether on-premises with things like RabbitMQ or in the cloud with SQS. Some might have heard about this thing called NServiceBus but thought to themselves, meh, the API of the queue is good enough, why introduce another dependency? So, here's the thing. Whether it's the ability to trace an asynchronous, branching message-flow across multiple endpoints, or writing time-based business logic with the saga pattern, or properly monitoring errors and performance - there's a lot more to NServiceBus that you might have thought.
